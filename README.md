Description
===========
The Sublime Text BeyondCompare plugin is a modified version of the excellent [WinMerge/FileMerge](https://github.com/SublimeText/WinMerge) plugin.

[BeyondCompare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/) is a nice GUI file difference engine that is cross platform, with support for both Windows and OSX. This package adds support to Sublime Text 2 and 3 for allowing you to diff the last two active views, even if they are in different Sublime windows.

Package Installation
====================
Install using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) by searching for "BeyondCompare".

Alternativly, bring up a command line in the Packages/ folder of your Sublime user folder, and execute the following:
> git clone git://github.com/npadley/BeyondCompare.git

When you launch Sublime Text, it will pick up the contents of this package so that you can consume the goodness that it provides.

Features
